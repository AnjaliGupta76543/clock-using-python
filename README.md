🚀 Learning Project: Digital Clock with Python and Tkinter ⏰

I recently created a digital clock using Python's Tkinter library. This clock dynamically updates and displays the current time in HH:MM
format as well as the date, including the year and day of the week. I designed it with a simple, clean user interface featuring color customization to enhance the display. It was a fun and practical way to dive deeper into GUI development and better understand time functions in Python.

Grateful for the continuous learning journey! 🙌
